Common settings:
	Target: evolve efficient locomotion on land and in water

	Multi-evaluation: 2
	Standard.expdef changes: raise water to 5 after one eval (on land) in multi evaluation, decrease back to -1 after second eval (after in water) + see Fitness

	Encoding: f1
	
	Starting population:
		- 50 base sticks (X) <- make more starting points so evolution has a chance to take multiple paths from beginning
		
	Neurons to add:
		- smell, off
		- differentiate, on
		- water detector, on
		- random noise, on
		- sinus generator, on
		- delay, on
		- threshold, on
	
	Stop:
		- 25000 creature evaluations or
		- stagnation (5000 creature evaluations with no best improvement)

	Other: 
		- don't simulate genotypes with warnings, on
		- log every 10 evaluations (creature evaluations <- it is implied by new standard.expdef, multieval restricted from it)
		- boost phase after stagnation, off <- doubles multieval (stated in tooltip) -> breaks our fitness
		- performance sampling period & while waiting: 250
		- kill if no stabilization after: 50000


Param1 "average fitness":
	Fitness: average of distance of 2 evaluations: on land and in water, for water - distance is decreased by water level and increased by vertical pos up to water level so drowning doesn't count (done in Standard.expdef)

Param2 "geometric mean fitness":
	Fitness: geometric mean of distance of 2 evaluations: on land and in water (done in Standard.expdef), for water - distance is decreased by water level and increased by vertical pos up to water level so drowning doesn't count
		- geometric mean turned on by "dirty trick" - setting size property on World to 20.001 from 20.0 -> handled in expdef; size>20

Param3 "geometric mean fitness with high variance/exploration - lower selection pressure and no crossover, higher gene pool":
	Fitness: geometric mean of distance of 2 evaluations: on land and in water (done in Standard.expdef), for water - distance is decreased by water level and increased by vertical pos up to water level so drowning doesn't count
		- geometric mean turned on by "dirty trick" - setting size property on World to 20.002 from 20.0 -> handled in expdef; size>20
	Selection: Tournament of 2 genotypes
	Crossover: 0
	Mutated: 72
	Unchanged: 28
	Gene pool: 200
